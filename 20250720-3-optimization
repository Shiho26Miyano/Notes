Usage tracking to monitor costs


✅ 1. Caching System for API Responses
Purpose: Store frequently accessed API results temporarily to avoid redundant computation or external calls.

Benefits:

Improved Performance: Reduces response time by serving cached data instead of recalculating or refetching.

Reduced Load: Decreases stress on backend services or databases.

Cost Efficiency: Minimizes the need to hit third-party APIs (especially if they're paid per request).

Better User Experience: Faster responses improve frontend responsiveness.

✅ 2. Rate Limiting to Prevent Abuse
Purpose: Control how many requests a client can make to an API within a given timeframe.

Benefits:

Prevents Abuse: Blocks malicious users or bots from overwhelming your API.

Protects System Stability: Keeps backend services from being overloaded.

Fair Use Enforcement: Ensures shared resources are fairly distributed among users.

Security: Mitigates denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and scraping attempts.

✅ 3. Usage Tracking to Monitor Costs
Purpose: Log and analyze how your API is being used, by whom, and how often.

Benefits:

Cost Awareness: Helps you understand and optimize cloud/API costs (especially important for third-party services like OpenAI, AWS, etc.).

Billing Support: Enables per-user billing or quotas for SaaS platforms.

Analytics and Planning: Identify high-traffic endpoints and usage trends.

Debugging and Auditing: Detect abnormal spikes or misbehavior quickly.
