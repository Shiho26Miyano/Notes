What:
➤ Improve the responsiveness of the Stock Price Trend chart.

Why:
➤ To ensure fast, smooth user interaction on all devices, especially mobile and low-end desktops.



How (the solution):
This will involve:
- Fetching all data (3 years) upfront
- Filtering the data client-side when the slider changes (no server calls)
- Using a more efficient chart update mechanism

1. Data Fetching Strategy:
- The first time stocks are selected, we fetch the full 3 years of data at once
- This data is stored in memory to avoid repeated server calls
- When the time range slider is moved, we filter the data client-side instead of fetching from the server again
2. Smooth UI Updates:
- Chart updates happen instantly when you move the time range slider
- No more waiting for API calls to complete when changing date ranges
- The chart responds as smoothly as the Stock Stability Explorer charts
3. Enhanced User Experience:
- The page now loads with the chart already displayed (with default time range)
- Moving the slider provides immediate visual feedback
- Only when you select different stocks does it need to fetch from the server


To use the chart:
When the page loads, it will fetch 3 years of data for any initially selected stocks
As you move the time range slider, the chart will update instantly
If you select different stocks, it will automatically fetch their data if needed
This approach gives you the same smooth, responsive experience that you see in the Stock Stability Explorer section while keeping all the functionality of the Stock Price Trends feature.
