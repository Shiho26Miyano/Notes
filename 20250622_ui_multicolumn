[Issue 1]implement the organized, multi-column UI 
Reorganizing the UI into a Dashboard Layout
Now that the backend is stable, I will implement the organized, multi-column dashboard layout.
Left Column: This will contain the main interactive tools:
Trading Strategy Backtester
Human Sentiment Explorer
Right Column: This will contain the primary data visualizations:
Market Overtime chart
Volatility Explorer chart
Ask Your Question (the voice/text AI tool)
[Answer]
New Dashboard Layout: The index.html file now implements a two-column layout.
Left Column: Contains the interactive tools ("Trading Strategy Backtester" and "Human Sentiment Explorer").
Right Column: Contains the data visualizations and the AI-powered "Ask Your Question" tool.
Updated JavaScript: The static/main.js file has been rewritten to correctly initialize all components in their new positions, ensuring all charts and tools are fully functional.
Visual Polish: I've added the "Let's PLAY" title and the avatars, along with other styling improvements to make the dashboard look just like your design.
